# Introduction
The SXA Styleguide is an education site based on SXA that helps explaining the inner working and illustrating best practices. 

It should not be considered as a demo environment for SXA or Sitecore in general. For demo purposes we like to refer you to [Habitat Home](https://github.com/Sitecore/Sitecore.HabitatHome.Platform), the official demo environment maintained by Sitecore and available as open-source.

## Important Notice

### Requirements
The Styleguide is built to support **[Sitecore Experience Platform 9.3](https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Platform/93/Sitecore_Experience_Platform_93_Initial_Release.aspx)** using **[Sitecore Experience Accelerator (SXA) 9.3](https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Accelerator/9x/Sitecore_Experience_Accelerator_930.aspx)**.

### Installation
You can install the styleguide on a Sitecore 9.3 instance with SXA 9.3 installed. Installation can be done using the package provided in this repository. Alternatively you can build the solution by running the TODO.ps1 file
