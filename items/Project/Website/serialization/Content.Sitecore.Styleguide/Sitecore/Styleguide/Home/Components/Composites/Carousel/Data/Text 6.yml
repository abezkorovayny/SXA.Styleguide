        <h2>Showing more</h2>
        <p>The default carousel slide layout consists of an image, plus an optional piece of text and a link. This fits most of the common use scenarios but is sometimes not enough and something more elaborate is needed to satisfy extraordinary needs. You can edit each slide and customize it by adding or removing elements (like texts, links, images, videos). Also, new slide layouts pre-configured with elements you need can be easily added with minimum development effort to define your named custom slide types.</p>
        <p>We have disabled the auto-rotate functionality in the carousel below so you can fully absorb the flexibility of the content inside. Work with the map, watch a video and the old carousel classic... an image.</p>
