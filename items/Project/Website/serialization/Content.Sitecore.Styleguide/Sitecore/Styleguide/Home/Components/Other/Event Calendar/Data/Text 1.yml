        <p>If your business is about conferences or trainings you will welcome the Event List component with widely spread arms. We know that events require special treatment so we created a special list just so you can put all your events there.</p>
        <p>And should you need more visual way of showing your events you can always show them on Event Calendar so everyone can book the date.</p>
