      Hint: Text
      Value: When you do not have the luxury of showing the whole path because it is too long for the space you have you can configure the breadcrumb to hide elements in the middle. The path will contract middle elements as width shrinks e.g. &nbsp;if you shrink your browser to show as much as it can.
