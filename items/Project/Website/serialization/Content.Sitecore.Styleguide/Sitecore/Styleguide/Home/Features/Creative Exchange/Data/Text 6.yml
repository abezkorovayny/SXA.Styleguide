        <h2>What CAN'T I do offline?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="-/media/6D6708EF071F4065AF3C3FC0A4068F8D.ashx?h=159&amp;w=200" style="height: 159px; width: 200px; float: left; margin-right: 10px;" />In a word: content. Any changes to the HTML that are made (with the exception of new classes applied to the SXA components) will be ignored on import.</p>
        <p>Content entry is a parallel stream of work which is ongoing and managed on the SXA platform. Therefore, the content that is included in the package is a snapshot that can be used for review but is mainly exported to allow the UI developer to work within a more realistic world than lorem ipsum.</p>
