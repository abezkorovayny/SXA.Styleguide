      Hint: PromoText2
      Value: All SXA components are designed to be as skinnable as possible. We know that you will be placing them in all sorts of different designs and contexts, and will want them to look totally different from project to project. When the CSS and Javascript are applied by the Theme developer, the components don't fall over.
