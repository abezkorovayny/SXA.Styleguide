            Optionally configure per-instance settings.

            * "id" is the name of the JSS app the node instance is associated with (each app gets its own instance)
            * When using node to render individual JavaScript renderings, "id" will be the value specified in the rendering "Server Script Path" field, e.g. /dist/myComponents/components.bundle.js
              - This means there will be one node instance per script path. Therefore, it is HIGHLY recommended that your individual JS renderings are bundled into as few files as possible to
                prevent the creation of an overwhelming number of node instances.

            * Setting the "inherits" attribute to "true" on the WatchFileExtensions or EnvironmentVariables will merge the per-instance settings with any inherited settings.
            * Setting the "inherits" attribute to "false" means the per-instance settings will be the _only_ setting values used.

            * For EnvironmentVariables, if "inherits" is true and any variable names (keys) collide with inherited variables, the per-instance variable value will be used.

            * IMPORTANT: Node instances _must_ have unique debugging ports. If you try to create multiple node instances with the same debugger port, those node processes will exit.
