        <div>SXA is a platform and a concept that enables organizations to perform quick delivery of sites, using standardized sets of functionality with minimum-to-no CMS development. For the purpose of achieving this goal, Sitecore Experience Accelerator utilizes a number of concepts, like grid frameworks and a componentized architecture, to allow for easy and consistent styling of pages and ease of design.</div>
        <p>Every feature of Experience Accelerator comes with productivity in mind - it is meant to be an expert tool that enables the delivery of websites quickly, with minimum custom development. This, however, might mean something different for different people - that is why SXA clearly defines its target audiences and plans its roadmap with the acute awareness of our clients.</p>
