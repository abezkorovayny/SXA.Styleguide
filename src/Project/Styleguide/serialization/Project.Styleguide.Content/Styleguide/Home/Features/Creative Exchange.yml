        <p>Creative Exchange simply allows your creative and front-end teams to work in parallel with your UX and your content teams. It is a tool that does a full export of the site you are working on into an offline package. This package includes all the pages and content in their current state. Your creative people can then skin the site in whatever tools are their preference.</p>
        <p>They do not need access to nor require to possess any knowledge of Sitecore. Once they have completed branding the site they can send the package back, and using the Creative Exchange Import tool, the new skin can be applied to the site. In the mean time content production can continue in the wireframe, or a temporary theme.</p>
