        <p>As you build your wireframes, you will most likely sketch all sorts of ideas and fragments that end up being used on the completed wireframes. Often one idea will become a structural element used on many different completed layouts.</p><p><br /></p>
        <p>SXA is built with the same philosophy. "Partials" are quite simply bits of design. Pieces that can be put together to create a completed layout. Pieces that can be reused on different layouts.
        They can even inherit from each other so that you can build increasingly complex designs from a basic set of reusable snippets and manage them all in a clear and concise way.</p><p><br /></p>
        <p>All of this is done on the platform, with proper workflows and version control!</p>
