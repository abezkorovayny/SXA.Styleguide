        <h2>The Toolbox</h2>
        <p>Sitecore Experience Accelerator (SXA) introduces&nbsp;a set of reusable components which are presented to the author in the Experience Editor. You simply pick them up and place them on the page using the <a href="/showcase/features/drag-and-drop-editing">Drag &amp; Drop</a> functionality.</p>
        <h3>Content &amp; Layout</h3>
        <div>SXA components offer a wide range of content needs; from simple text and images to videos and social media plugins. Also, you can structure your pages using the Column and Row Splitters. This gives the marketer enormous power to be creative and change the content as they need.</div>
        <h3>Rendering Variants</h3>
        <p>Rather than having lots of different components that are slight variations of the same thing, we have <a href="/showcase/features/rendering-variants">rendering variants</a>. These are configurable adaptations of the core components. For example, an article listing might show a thumbnail or some extra metadata: this would be a "variant" of the&nbsp;<a href="/showcase/components/page-content/page-list">Page List</a> component. There are a set of out-of-the-box variants which come with all our components, and you can, of course, create your own in the Sitecore Experience Editor. The author simply chooses which variant they want when they place the component.</p>
        <h3>Skinnable</h3>
        <p>All SXA components are designed to be as skinnable as possible. We know that you will be placing them in all sorts of different designs and contexts, and will want them to look totally different from project to project. When the CSS and Javascript are applied by the <a href="/showcase/features/themes">Theme</a>&nbsp;developer, the components don't fall over.</p>
        <h3>Robust &amp; Responsive</h3>
        <p>We know that our websites must work on desktop, mobile, tablet. They must work whether placed in a full width or narrow column and regardless of what else is on the page. You may want to have many instances of the same component on the same page. No problem, SXA components are robust and tested to work in as many scenarios as possible. They are also crafted carefully to work on any grid you might deploy on your site. Each of our components can be configured&nbsp;to take any number of columns the grid system support and the width can vary from breakpoint to breakpoint so you can be sure <a href="/showcase/features/layout">any Layout is achievable</a>.</p>
        <h3>Build your own?</h3>
        <div>If you cannot achieve the desired results with the components we have, and there's no variant which can help you, then you can develop your own. SXA components are basically Sitecore components with a little extra wrapper and SXA magic. Your .NET developers can produce components specifically for your project.</div>
