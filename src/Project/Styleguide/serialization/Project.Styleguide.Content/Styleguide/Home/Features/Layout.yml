        <p>Layouts in SXA are built using grid systems like&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" title="Bootstrap" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" title="Foundation" target="_blank">Foundation</a> or our Responsive Web Design version of <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://960.gs/" title="960 Grid System " target="_blank">960 Grid System</a>. The platform ships with just one single Sitecore layout but allows you to build your custom designs from it.</p>
        <p>This magical transformation is possible thanks to so-called splitters, which as the name suggests splits an area into smaller ones. There are two types of splitters: row splitter and column splitter, dividing space into rows and columns respectively. You may not believe it, until you try it yourself, how easy it is to compose a layout in SXA.</p>
        <p>On top of that our components now allow you to configure how much width they will take so, you can achieve&nbsp;a design many ways depending on your needs.</p>
