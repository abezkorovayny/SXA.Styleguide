        <h2>Time To Market</h2>
        <p>In a traditional project, the Site Production is carried out in a linear fashion, with the user experience and design work done before coding begins. Content Entry is left until all these things have been finished. Even if these streams of work are successful, the time to market can be slow.</p>

        <p>With SXA, these streams can be brought into a parallel Site Production (as the diagram below indicates). This way, once a basic user experience plan is in place we can get started on the platform straight away.</p><p><br /></p>
