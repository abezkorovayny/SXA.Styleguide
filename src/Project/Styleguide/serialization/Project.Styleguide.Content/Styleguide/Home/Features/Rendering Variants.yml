      Hint: Content
      Value: |
        <p>Like it says on the tin: Rendering Variants are variations of components. When a user places a component on a page, they are able to select different ways that the component may appear or what content it shows. This might vary quite a lot from project to project, so we have created a facility for a "super user" to create their own Rendering Variants. This avoids the need for building specific components which are only slight variations of existing components.</p>
