        <p>When you are building websites, you will often want the same layout, or piece of layout on a set of pages. Rather than having to build this for each page, or having to rely on a developer to construct these as one-off components for you, we give you Partial Designs. These are managed by you just like pages, using the Drag &amp; Drop interface. Partials can be whole page structures or reusable bits of content to be applied across your site.</p>
        </div>
